# Introduction

Say you have a nice piece of Python code; a couple of small related functions, or perhaps even a medium-sized module with a few hundred lines of code. And say that you end up using that piece of code time and again; maybe you keep copying it into different projects or repositories, or you keep importing it from some dedicated utility-code folder youâ€™ve set up in a specific path.

This tutorial is inspired from [PyPi.md](https://gist.github.com/gboeing/dcfaf5e13fad16fc500717a3a324ec17)
